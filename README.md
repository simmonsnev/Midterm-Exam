Dashboard 1 Summary:

World Map was used to show an averaged production/consumption value for each 
country from 1961-2022. Countries were filled in accordingly with how large
or small their value was. Next two plots take the maximum and minimum value
from each continent and compare them from 1961-2022. Finally, a correlation
plot is made to showcase the effects of increasing production resulting
in increasing consumption on average.

Dashboard 2 Summary:

Two Taylor Swift albums were chosen: Evermore and Folklore. These two albums were
first made into word clouds showcasing the most used words negating the stop words.
Then the next two plots were bar graphs showcasing the sentiment values of each
of the albums. Evermore appears to be slightly more positive in terms of sentiment
value, but only slightly. Lastly, two plots attempted to show correlation 
with positive sentiment and two predictors. First, danceability seems to be
somewhat correlated with positive sentiment, and tempo does not appear to be 
correlated with positive sentiment.
